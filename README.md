The program takes input in the form of order information, which encompasses the quantity, price, and details of a product.  
Afterward, it generates a record in the database and provides the number of the most recent invoice.    
Additionally, there is an option to separately view all records in the database. The program has been customized to individual needs.   
For example, it includes customizing the regular expression accepted for further processing and modifying the way it stores information about orders in the database (no invoice number is generated for orders outside the years 2022-2023).
